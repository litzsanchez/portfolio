    <h2>Litz's Review</h2>
    <P>This movie is about a young boy named Charlie. He wins a contest where he had to find a golden pass in a chocolate bar which there were only a few out there. He found the golden pass and got to get a tour with his grandpa, 7 other winners, and the
        owner of the chocolate factory, Willy Wonka. The factory was very famous because of the awsome candie that they made. Choclate wasn't the only thing made, they made bubble gum, jaw breakers, etc. Willy Wonka was giving them all challenges with
        out the even noticing. Out of all the other winners, Charlie was the only one who didn't end up getting blowded from a candie, nor did anything dumb. Willy Wonka noticed that Charlie was a young and clever young man. The purpose of this tour was
        to find somebody who could handle the factory and soon to be the owner of it. Wonka confessed to Charlie his plan of giving the factory to him and that would mean that he wouldn't live as poorly as he did that moment. That oen golden pass literally
        changed Charlie's life in a blink of an eye. </P>
