A personal goal i have is to get better at writing essays for English class. I want to get better in writing essays because i know that in the future I'm gonna have to write a lot of essays to apply to scholarships, colleges, and maybe even jobs in the future. Another goal I have is to pass my freshman year with a 3.3 or higher.
    Even though it's hard for me to keep up with my grades, I still want to have grades because if i don't it will affect me in the future.</td>
