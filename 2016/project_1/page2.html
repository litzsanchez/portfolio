                <td class="lol">One of my favorite hobbies to do is to fan girl over CNCO, which like i said is my favorite boy band at the moment. I really like this band because they're all young, talented, and humble. I like the way allof their voices are combined. I also like their taste in music and style.
                This band is formed by Erick Brian Colon Arista(who is 16 years old), Joel Pimentel De Leon(who is 18 years old), Christopher Bryant Velez Munoz(who is 21 years old), Zabdiel De Jesus Colon(who is 19 years old), and Richard Yashel Camacho Lumnay(who is 20 years old).
                This latin band mainly sings pop rock songs. They were participants in a live tv show named La Banda, who was managed by Simon Cowell and Ricky Martin, and they were the five winners of the competition chosen by the fans.
                The band was created on December 13, 2015. </td>

                <td class="cncoo"> My favorite  member of CNCO is Erick Brian Colon Arista. Erick is the smallest one of the group and he is currently 16 years old.
                He's always laughing and joking about everything which is something i like about him, besides his beatiful green eyes. He comes from a family of 4, his father, mother, and old sister, including him. Erick is from Cuba but he moved to Miami a few years ago. Erick is the rapper of the group because the rythm goes with his voice and in my opinion he does it better.
