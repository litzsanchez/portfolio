      <p class="Site"> Hello person who is reading this, I am Litz but actually supposed to be spelled Litzy. I am a 14 year-old freshman who attends CCPA. I was born in the county of Merced but i moved to Oakland a few years ago. I come from a family of four, my mom,
        dad, my sister, and myself. I am currently obsessed with a Latin boy band called CNCO. Ed Sheeran, The Chainsmokers, Ariana Grande, and Shawn Mendes are also some of my favorite artists. My favorite color is green, if everything i own could be
        green, i'd be the happiest child alive. I really like summer time because i get a break from quizes, homework, and waking up early in the mornings. I also love summer time because i get to go to many conerts of my favorite artists.
      </p>
      <h2>My Skills</h2>
      <p class="Ebca">I like to take pictures and polaroids. I also like to make drawings and paintings of cartoon characters or singers. I also like to make picture and video edits because i feel like they're very artsy for some reason. I also really like to read. I
        don't like to read hard cover books though. I like to read fan-fiction on an app called Wattpad. I also like to ride bike, play soccer, and volleyball on my free time outside. </p>
